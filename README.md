## What that plugin does
* Shows your pickpocketing success rate in realtime
* Shows you the number of Dodgy Necklace charges
* Shows you how many Coin Pouches you're carrying, if applicable

## Customization
* Toggle Dodgy Necklace charges.
    * Some of you Level 99s don't need fancy jewelry to pickpocket.
* Toggle Pouches Counter
    * This  plugin is smart enough to not show it if the NPC doesn't drop them but, you can turn it off completely if you like.
* Warning Threshold
    * This determines when the text on the overlay turns red when your charges drop to or below this threshold.
* Overlay Duration
    * How long, in seconds, should the overlay remain in between pickpockets. 0 = Never goes away.
* Reset Rate
    * This determines when this plugin will reset your rate calculation. You can set it to on Logout or on Runelite Exit.
